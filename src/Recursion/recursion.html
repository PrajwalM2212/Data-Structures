<h3>Recursive Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Recursive problems are solved by reducing it to simpler problems of same kind.
    </li>
    <li>This is done until a situation is reached where the problem is simple enough to be solved directly.
    </li>
    <li>The simplest problem is called the base case
    </li>
    <li>Base case stops recursion because it does not make another call to a method.
    </li>
</ol>
